Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.00,0:00:06.00,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Touko? If I really *am* sick, what do we do?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:06.00,0:00:09.00,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,If you're sick?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:09.00,0:00:11.08,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,If... you know.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:11.51,0:00:21.46,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Since you're so young, and your symptoms are relatively minor, I wouldn't want to use medicine to treat you.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:21.46,0:00:23.91,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Why not?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.91,0:00:27.68,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Lain, your body can already recover from sickness quite well.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.68,0:00:32.15,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,But depending on medicines will weaken your body's ability to recover on its own.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:32.62,0:00:37.80,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Children especially shouldn't rely too heavily on medication.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.80,0:00:39.80,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,So what are you going to do?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.80,0:00:47.06,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,We can use psychotherapy - like how we're talking now.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:47.06,0:00:48.35,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Only talking?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:48.73,0:00:54.51,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,It's hard to explain. For example, we have a program for recovering alcoholics.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.51,0:01:00.77,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Everyone shares stories, and discusses what led them to developing their drinking habits.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.46,0:01:06.86,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,It's called group therapy - but, I don't think it really works.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.86,0:01:08.46,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Why not?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:08.46,0:01:14.35,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I don't think people who use the persuasion of others to fuel their recovery tend to stay on the right track.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:15.02,0:01:21.84,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,They feel as if they've recovered fully, but once they're alone again they lose the momentum and fall back on old habits.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.33,0:01:24.55,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I've seen a lot of people like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:24.55,0:01:26.66,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Then what do we do instead?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.66,0:01:33.13,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I'd rather work with someone one on one - like we're doing now, Lain.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:33.53,0:01:34.48,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,And?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.48,0:01:38.00,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,And then, I encourage my patients to reflect on themselves.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:38.42,0:01:45.91,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Non-directive psychotherapy. Instead of giving the patient specific instructions, I try to analyze them from a more neutral ground.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:46.51,0:01:52.66,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,This makes it easier for them to look at themselves and recognize what's wrong, so they can work towards recovery with the help of their doctor.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.66,0:01:54.88,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,They learn how to heal on their own.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.82,0:01:59.82,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,When they can do that, that's when they're truly cured.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:59.82,0:02:03.60,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Is it really that easy to get better?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:03.60,0:02:06.37,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,It sounds easy. However...
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.37,0:02:11.17,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,The truth is, it's incredibly difficult.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.17,0:02:13.17,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,Difficult?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:14.71,0:02:21.51,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,(yawning) Sorry - I haven't been getting enough sleep.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.51,0:02:26.60,Default,Lain,0,0,0,,You're tired. Shouldn't you get a little more rest?
