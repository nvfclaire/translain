Dialogue: 0,0:00:01.15,0:00:06.14,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,According to the client's mother, she has frequent nightmares.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:06.63,0:00:09.38,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,But, they're far from ordinary nightmares.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:09.38,0:00:13.73,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,They're much more realistic, almost hallucinatory in nature.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:13.75,0:00:16.18,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,It seems they're the reason she started counselling.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:17.09,0:00:21.22,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,As for the nightmares, Lain typically doesn't elaborate on their contents,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:21.53,0:00:27.02,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,but she says she hears cryptic voices, or that her eyes are forced open, as she's shown what seems like a video.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.06,0:00:31.60,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Or even she'll be playing in the garden with friends, and before she realizes, she's suddenly alone.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:31.60,0:00:36.72,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,As of now, these seem to be the product of normal childhood fears.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.08,0:00:42.12,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,To think that these symptoms will fade as she finds her sense of self,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:42.51,0:00:44.48,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,well, it's certainly optimistic,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.48,0:00:48.08,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,but based on other clinical studies with children, I think it's quite likely.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.04,0:00:53.88,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,Her answers were clear, and she seemed to be present enough that even if symptoms continued,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:53.90,0:00:57.04,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,the client would more than likely be able to live a normal life.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:57.04,0:01:03.00,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,However, what concerns me the most, are the hallucinations her mother had mentioned.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:04.35,0:01:09.06,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,It's very unusual for a child her age to be experiencing these symptoms.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:10.54,0:01:16.85,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,The most important issue is to determine what's causing these delusions and hallucinations.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:16.85,0:01:21.37,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I'll have to determine this through our counselling sessions.
