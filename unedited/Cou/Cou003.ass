Dialogue: 0,0:00:11.35,0:00:16.65,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,It's like tea - it can be wildly different based on how the leaves are picked and steeped.

Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.16,0:01:45.48,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,but rather helping you to explain things you don’t understand.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.48,0:01:48.61,Default,Touko,0,0,0,,I'm more than happy to talk to you about anything that's bothering you.
