00:00.750 --> 00:03.600
Do you know where I'm going?

00:04.500 --> 00:05.720
I don't know either,

00:06.530 --> 00:08.550
but I'm about to be born.

00:09.180 --> 00:11.180
Is this really the future of humanity?

00:12.060 --> 00:14.600
You can think that if you'd like.

00:15.760 --> 00:18.100
Don't you need a body to to be a human?

00:19.000 --> 00:21.540
Some people have bodies that aren't necessarily human.

00:22.270 --> 00:22.800
And me?

00:23.630 --> 00:24.770
Am I not human?

00:25.730 --> 00:26.970
Lain is Lain.

00:27.680 --> 00:29.260
What does it mean to be human?

00:29.880 --> 00:31.580
If I have a body, does that make me human?

00:32.400 --> 00:33.390
I am me.

00:34.140 --> 00:36.220
Are you trying to blend in?

00:36.990 --> 00:39.930
You need a body if you're going to live in the real world.

00:40.800 --> 00:42.350
Suicide would be stupid.

00:42.990 --> 00:44.460
You're better off dead.

00:45.160 --> 00:46.290
Don't I need my body?

00:46.960 --> 00:48.650
What if I need it someday?

00:50.040 --> 00:51.030
I'm not sure.

00:51.930 --> 00:55.520
But you don't need a body to live in the Wired.

00:56.360 --> 00:58.250
I need the memories of my body.

00:58.610 --> 01:00.600
What if I forget my flesh and blood?

01:01.410 --> 01:03.090
Couldn't that change my beliefs?

01:04.160 --> 01:05.530
And what of you changing them?

01:06.460 --> 01:08.400
There's no guarantee that you will.

01:09.470 --> 01:12.650
Hey, Lain, what do I need to get on the Wired?

01:13.930 --> 01:14.820
Will and existence.

01:15.400 --> 01:16.640
The rest is just data.
