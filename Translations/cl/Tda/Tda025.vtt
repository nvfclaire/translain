00:00.130 --> 00:02.270
(giggling)

00:02.280 --> 00:06.120
Tomorrow, Takeshi and I are going on our first date in Japan!

00:06.150 --> 00:08.370
I haven't been this excited in a long time.

00:09.520 --> 00:11.200
What outfit should I wear?

00:11.760 --> 00:15.200
Wearing something too flashy will probably start more rumors.

00:16.460 --> 00:22.470
I haven't bought clothes in a long time... or underwear.

00:23.130 --> 00:26.280
Not that I can even buy clothes at this time of day.

00:28.600 --> 00:31.500
But I can't just buy clothes in the middle of a date, either!

00:31.900 --> 00:34.260
Not in front of Takeshi.

00:34.680 --> 00:37.140
He'll start to think of me as <i>that</i> kind of girl.
