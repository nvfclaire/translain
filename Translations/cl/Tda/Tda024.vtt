00:00.120 --> 00:03.080
I met my first client today.

00:04.320 --> 00:07.170
Her name is Lain; she's 12 years old.

00:08.870 --> 00:11.160
When Professor Takashima assigned her to me,

00:11.300 --> 00:14.000
I was frustrated that he gave me a such a young client,

00:14.000 --> 00:17.610
since she's way out of the age range I specialize in.

00:18.150 --> 00:21.090
But, as soon as I saw her face, I felt at ease.

00:22.850 --> 00:25.400
Was it because she was so adorable?

00:26.360 --> 00:27.400
Hmmm.

00:28.590 --> 00:31.060
There was something oddly compelling about her.

00:32.850 --> 00:38.880
Anyway, within my age range or not, she's still my client.

00:40.000 --> 00:44.450
She seems to be experiencing extreme psychosis, and some level of mental instability.

00:45.720 --> 00:47.860
Is she be having trouble at home?

00:48.680 --> 00:52.300
Perhaps her childhood experiences have severely warped her self image.

00:54.100 --> 00:57.790
I hope I can help her.

00:59.150 --> 01:01.770
Little by little, I'll get her to open up more.

01:02.470 --> 01:03.850
I can't rush it.
