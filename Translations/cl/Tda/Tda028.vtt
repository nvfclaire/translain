00:00.260 --> 00:02.620
I met Lain for the second time today.

00:04.010 --> 00:07.260
She looked straight at me and called me "Doctor."

00:07.470 --> 00:10.200
It made me so happy, that my face turned bright red.

00:11.050 --> 00:13.600
Maybe she's already figured me out.

00:14.480 --> 00:16.850
If I get flustered just from being called "Doctor",

00:17.580 --> 00:19.960
It's pretty easy to tell that I'm still new...

00:22.920 --> 00:26.430
But still, I get that weird feeling that I got when we first met.

00:26.520 --> 00:28.970
I can't seem to place it.

00:30.090 --> 00:31.340
When I look in her eyes,

00:31.630 --> 00:34.100
it feels like she can see right through me.

00:35.760 --> 00:41.310
Do I look unreliable to her?

00:42.050 --> 00:47.610
Even so, I wish I was that calm when I was her age.

00:49.170 --> 00:52.900
I wouldn't quite call her an elegant girl,

00:55.150 --> 00:59.560
but it's safe to say she seems pretty relaxed.

01:01.420 --> 01:04.010
I thought she'd be acting like a child,

01:04.740 --> 01:06.570
but she really feels like an adult.

01:07.440 --> 01:10.650
Well, they do say kids grow up pretty quick these days.

01:11.600 --> 01:14.820
Lots of my relatives' kids are mature for their age too.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.600
Times are changing, huh?

01:18.430 --> 01:21.690
Ahhh, I'm starting to talk like an old woman!

01:23.240 --> 01:25.940
Don't let your hallucinations get to you, Lain!

01:26.650 --> 01:28.880
I'll help you get better, I promise.
