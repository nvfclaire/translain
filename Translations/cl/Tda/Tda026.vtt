00:00.200 --> 00:02.550
Takeshi and I had dinner together today.

00:03.480 --> 00:06.850
Since I hadn't seen him in ages, I talked so much he could barely get a word in!

00:08.350 --> 00:10.490
He was surprised, to say the least.

00:11.390 --> 00:16.680
In the end, Takeshi couldn't get any time off for work for Golden Week, so I didn't get to see him at all...

00:17.600 --> 00:23.870
I planned on sulking for a while, but I was so happy to see Takeshi's face that I got a little carried away.

00:24.740 --> 00:28.880
But he still listened to every word, smiling the whole time.

00:29.900 --> 00:36.450
And the best part - he even brought me flowers as a gift for passing my exams!

00:36.900 --> 00:39.950
Every girl loves getting flowers.

00:41.110 --> 00:43.850
Maybe I'll dry them out.

00:46.040 --> 00:49.860
I want this happiness to last forever.
