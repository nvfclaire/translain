Kanako said that she though the freedom and liberation of American living had rubbed off on me.

00:07.100 --> 00:09.560
I was a bit embarrassed to hear that.

00:10.870 --> 00:17.020
Looking at the postcard photo from Harumi’s honeymoon, I laughed.

00:18.180 --> 00:21.460
I’m jealous, though I pretend not to be.

00:23.090 --> 00:26.480
Kanako said that she still has no plans of getting married.

00:27.560 --> 00:32.030
I hope that she doesn’t proclaim all of a sudden that she will get married, like Harumi did.

00:33.030 --> 00:35.350
What will I do when Kanako gets married?

00:35.350 --> 00:36.950
I’ll be too sad.

00:39.930 --> 00:42.850
Takeshi-san, what’s going on with you?
