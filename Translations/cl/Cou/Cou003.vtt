00:00.250 --> 00:02.410
Is there a variety of milk as well?

00:02.880 --> 00:06.440
Yep! They're practically all the same.

00:06.500 --> 00:09.440
The different types are just based on how they're processed.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.250
Different types?

00:11.350 --> 00:16.650
It's like tea - it can be wildly different based on how the leaves are picked and steeped.

00:16.780 --> 00:18.650
Even if you use the same leaves.

00:18.820 --> 00:19.860
People, too?

00:19.950 --> 00:20.160
Hmm?

00:21.000 --> 00:22.700
Are there different types of people?

00:24.460 --> 00:29.960
Not really types, but everybody varies from person to person.

00:30.660 --> 00:35.960
For example, you don’t like tea, but I really like it.

00:36.720 --> 00:41.080
Or like how some people get upset stomachs from milk, while some don't, right?

00:41.950 --> 00:47.450
Some people can even get used to drinking milk when they're older, like me.

00:48.300 --> 00:52.930
Even you might learn to like tea one day, right?

00:53.560 --> 00:56.690
It doesn't have to be good or bad,

00:57.500 --> 01:00.170
things just naturally vary from person to person.

01:00.700 --> 01:02.530
Don't worry if you're different,

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
really, you should be proud of it!

01:06.850 --> 01:07.650
Proud?

01:10.360 --> 01:11.210
I’m sorry...

01:11.840 --> 01:15.210
That’s right, you're troubled, aren't you?

01:16.500 --> 01:18.720
You don't have to boast about it or anything,

01:18.720 --> 01:21.900
but I meant more that you shouldn't worry about what others think.

01:22.850 --> 01:26.420
Am I different for having strange dreams?

01:27.020 --> 01:31.940
It could be different, but it could also be totally normal.

01:32.580 --> 01:38.100
That's what I'm here for - if you're worried, I want to help you with it.

01:39.420 --> 01:42.160
Not to help you stop having those dreams,

01:42.160 --> 01:45.480
but rather helping you to explain things you don’t understand.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.610
I'm more than happy to talk to you about anything that's bothering you.

01:49.650 --> 01:53.960
I’ve studied a lot to help you with this kinda thing.

01:54.050 --> 01:55.500
I’m still studying, actually.

01:56.570 --> 02:05.190
If you’re ever in trouble, don't be afraid to come talk with me.

02:07.190 --> 02:11.060
I’d like to know more about you, Lain.

02:12.370 --> 02:13.300
Is that okay?

02:15.170 --> 02:17.400
Wonderful!

02:18.170 --> 02:20.410
Starting today, let's be friends.

02:20.810 --> 02:22.000
You better visit!

02:22.000 --> 02:22.820
Promise?

02:23.360 --> 02:26.650
I want to learn about you, too!

02:26.840 --> 02:28.780
You can ask me anything you want.

02:29.200 --> 02:31.340
We'll look up anything you don't understand.

02:32.240 --> 02:35.320
I'll even make sure to get your favorite drink.

02:35.660 --> 02:36.570
What?

02:36.970 --> 02:39.150
Milk that doesn’t make your stomach rumble!
