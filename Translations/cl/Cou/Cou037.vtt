Touko? If I really *am* sick, what do we do?

00:06.000 --> 00:09.000
If you're sick?

00:09.000 --> 00:11.080
If... you know.

00:11.510 --> 00:21.460
Since you're so young, and your symptoms are relatively minor, I wouldn't want to use medicine to treat you.

00:21.460 --> 00:23.910
Why not?

00:23.910 --> 00:27.680
Lain, your body can already recover from sickness quite well.

00:27.680 --> 00:32.150
But depending on medicines will weaken your body's ability to recover on its own.

00:32.620 --> 00:37.800
Children especially shouldn't rely too heavily on medication.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.800
So what are you going to do?

00:39.800 --> 00:47.060
We can use psychotherapy - like how we're talking now.

00:47.060 --> 00:48.350
Only talking?

00:48.730 --> 00:54.510
It's hard to explain. For example, we have a program for recovering alcoholics.

00:54.510 --> 01:00.770
Everyone shares stories, and discusses what led them to developing their drinking habits.

01:01.460 --> 01:06.860
It's called group therapy - but, I don't think it really works.

01:06.860 --> 01:08.460
Why not?

01:08.460 --> 01:14.350
I don't think people who use the persuasion of others to fuel their recovery tend to stay on the right track.

01:15.020 --> 01:21.840
They feel as if they've recovered fully, but once they're alone again they lose the momentum and fall back on old habits.

01:22.330 --> 01:24.550
I've seen a lot of people like that.

01:24.550 --> 01:26.660
Then what do we do instead?

01:26.660 --> 01:33.130
I'd rather work with someone one on one - like we're doing now, Lain.

01:33.530 --> 01:34.480
And?

01:34.480 --> 01:38.000
And then, I encourage my patients to reflect on themselves.

01:38.420 --> 01:45.910
Non-directive psychotherapy. Instead of giving the patient specific instructions, I try to analyze them from a more neutral ground.

01:46.510 --> 01:52.660
This makes it easier for them to look at themselves and recognize what's wrong, so they can work towards recovery with the help of their doctor.

01:52.660 --> 01:54.880
They learn how to heal on their own.

01:55.820 --> 01:59.820
When they can do that, that's when they're truly cured.

01:59.820 --> 02:03.600
Is it really that easy to get better?

02:03.600 --> 02:06.370
It sounds easy. However...

02:06.370 --> 02:11.170
The truth is, it's incredibly difficult.

02:11.170 --> 02:13.170
Difficult?

02:14.710 --> 02:21.510
(yawning) Sorry - I haven't been getting enough sleep.

02:21.510 --> 02:26.600
You're tired. Shouldn't you get a little more rest?
