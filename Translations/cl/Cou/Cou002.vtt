00:00.000 --> 00:01.820
It smells wonderful.

00:02.980 --> 00:06.700
Here you go... What do you think?

00:08.700 --> 00:11.540
Seems like you're not a fan, huh?

00:11.980 --> 00:13.760
Too bitter? Want some sugar?

00:14.760 --> 00:18.720
Adding some milk might help remove some of that bitterness.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.100
Or would you like something else?

00:21.920 --> 00:23.320
I don’t like milk.

00:23.720 --> 00:27.630
I see... I'm sorry. I didn’t know.

00:28.400 --> 00:31.500
Want me to grab you some juice?

00:34.120 --> 00:35.020
I’m sorry...

00:36.180 --> 00:41.040
I didn't like tea when I was your age either.

00:43.040 --> 00:46.700
I mentioned that there's lots of different kinds of tea, right?

00:46.700 --> 00:48.700
There are teas that I don't like too.

00:49.280 --> 00:51.400
It doesn't mean I won't drink them,

00:51.530 --> 00:57.140
but I have my own tastes for which types of tea I like, too.

00:59.140 --> 01:00.970
What's your taste in drinks, Lain?

01:01.000 --> 01:03.700
Oh - is there any reason you don't like milk?

01:04.340 --> 01:06.040
It makes my stomach rumble.

01:06.280 --> 01:08.170
(giggling)

01:08.170 --> 01:11.400
Funnily enough, I was the same way when I was your age.

01:11.920 --> 01:14.540
Especially when they served milk at school lunches.

01:15.520 --> 01:17.000
I can drink it now, though!

01:18.000 --> 01:19.840
To be honest, I really like it...

01:20.500 --> 01:23.130
Can you have stomach-friendly milk?

01:23.880 --> 01:25.280
What kind of milk?

01:26.200 --> 01:30.780
I forget the name of it, but there's a type of milk that doesn't make your stomach rumble.

01:31.410 --> 01:34.880
It's for you, and other kids who had the same issue I did.

01:35.520 --> 01:38.720
If you ask your mother about it, I'm sure she can find you some!
