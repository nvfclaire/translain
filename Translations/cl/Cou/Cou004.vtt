8th of July, 2 p.m., 2nd session.

00:07.560 --> 00:09.880
Please come in.

00:10.640 --> 00:12.160
Dr. Touko, hello.

00:13.120 --> 00:14.780
Hello, Lain!

00:15.000 --> 00:15.800
Hello.

00:16.420 --> 00:17.850
Summer vacation is coming up!

00:18.200 --> 00:19.100
Are you excited?

00:19.820 --> 00:20.650
Not especially.

00:21.820 --> 00:22.650
Let's see...

00:23.250 --> 00:29.090
Let's play a game today, Lain! I brought this with me.

00:29.220 --> 00:30.200
What’s that?

00:30.770 --> 00:31.880
They're art supplies.

00:32.370 --> 00:33.730
Do you like to draw?

00:34.220 --> 00:35.180
Not really...

00:36.090 --> 00:36.730
Probably not.

00:37.450 --> 00:40.720
I see... unfortunate.

00:40.720 --> 00:42.940
Wait - do you know tic-tac-toe?

00:43.250 --> 00:46.120
I know what it is, but I don't really want to play right now.

00:48.020 --> 00:49.360
I’m sorry.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.700
I'm all out of ideas.

00:53.320 --> 00:56.530
Is there anything you'd like to do, Lain?

00:57.100 --> 00:59.080
I’d like to talk some more.

00:59.950 --> 01:00.740
Talk...

01:01.970 --> 01:03.320
Talk about what?

01:03.810 --> 01:04.830
Anything is fine.

01:05.750 --> 01:07.100
Let's talk about you.

01:07.650 --> 01:09.000
About me?

01:10.170 --> 01:13.260
I'm not really that interesting...

01:13.950 --> 01:14.600
Is that a no?

01:15.170 --> 01:17.180
No, not at all.

01:17.620 --> 01:20.930
But, I'm 27 years old.

01:21.130 --> 01:23.150
There'd be way too much to talk about!

01:23.350 --> 01:26.440
We'd have to start from the beginning, and it's a long story.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.620
Honestly, I don't really have anything interesting to say!

01:30.530 --> 01:32.420
What kind of doctor are you?

01:33.050 --> 01:35.170
Kind of doctor? Well,

01:35.400 --> 01:39.840
I help people like you, who have things they're worried about.

01:40.070 --> 01:43.530
And then I help them understand what they can do to fix it.

01:44.370 --> 01:45.040
Make sense?

01:46.350 --> 01:47.300
Ah...

01:48.150 --> 01:49.240
I knew it.

01:51.400 --> 01:52.220
What’s wrong?

01:53.040 --> 01:57.570
If I'm making you uncomfortable, let me know. You can be honest with me.

01:58.170 --> 01:59.820
I should be more careful, really.

02:00.700 --> 02:04.100
You shouldn’t worry so much.

02:04.580 --> 02:09.650
Just relax, and come have a nice talk with me once a month.

02:10.450 --> 02:11.000
Okay...
