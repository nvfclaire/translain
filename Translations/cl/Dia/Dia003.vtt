00:01.150 --> 00:06.140
According to the client's mother, she has frequent nightmares.

00:06.630 --> 00:09.380
But, they're far from ordinary nightmares.

00:09.380 --> 00:13.730
They're much more realistic, almost hallucinatory in nature.

00:13.750 --> 00:16.180
It seems they're the reason she started counselling.

00:17.090 --> 00:21.220
As for the nightmares, Lain typically doesn't elaborate on their contents,

00:21.530 --> 00:27.020
but she says she hears cryptic voices, or that her eyes are forced open, as she's shown what seems like a video.

00:27.060 --> 00:31.600
Or even she'll be playing in the garden with friends, and before she realizes, she's suddenly alone.

00:31.600 --> 00:36.720
As of now, these seem to be the product of normal childhood fears.

00:37.080 --> 00:42.120
To think that these symptoms will fade as she finds her sense of self,

00:42.510 --> 00:44.480
well, it's certainly optimistic,

00:44.480 --> 00:48.080
but based on other clinical studies with children, I think it's quite likely.

00:49.040 --> 00:53.880
Her answers were clear, and she seemed to be present enough that even if symptoms continued,

00:53.900 --> 00:57.040
the client would more than likely be able to live a normal life.

00:57.040 --> 01:03.000
However, what concerns me the most, are the hallucinations her mother had mentioned.

01:04.350 --> 01:09.060
It's very unusual for a child her age to be experiencing these symptoms.

01:10.540 --> 01:16.850
The most important issue is to determine what's causing these delusions and hallucinations.

01:16.850 --> 01:21.370
I'll have to determine this through our counselling sessions.
