New translation of Serial Experiments Lain for PSX, around 7% complete

## Info
This is an entire retranslation from square one, from Japanese to English. The pre-existing translations had some issues and missed meaning in certain lines, so I aim to fix this by redoing the entire translation from scratch.

I've been retranslating every file and writing them over the [lainass](https://github.com/lelenium/lainass) subtitles, (which are based on the psx.lain.pl translation), to ensure compatibility with LainTSX. I'll be doing this level by leve, but going backwards so that updates can be pushed out as fast as possible and so that players will catch up to the new translation, and not force our translation to attempt to catch up to them. 

## Usage
You can use this however you'd like, as long as you link back to this github, and my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nvf). Also, feel free to tag me in anything you make with these translations! I'd love to see it :smile:
